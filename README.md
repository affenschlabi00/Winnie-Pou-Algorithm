# Winnie-Pou-Algorithm

This Python algorithm calculates how many circles of a given radius can fit within a larger circle. This is useful for visualizing and optimizing the packing of items in a circular area, such as in a game or design layout.

## Dependencies
This algorithm requires the following dependencies:

    matplotlib
    customtkinter

You can install these dependencies using pip:

    pip install matplotlib
    pip install customtkinter
    
## Usage
To use this algorithm, simply run the Winnie-Pou-Algorithm.py script and you will understand it as you go.

## Output

The Algorithm will output the number of circles which you can pack in a bigger circle and the space that is used while packing.
